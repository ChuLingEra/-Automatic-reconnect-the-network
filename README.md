# Automatic-reconnect-the-network
_This project aims to solve the problem that the network authentication system of colleges and universities is disconnected from time to time,
leading to students' inability to access the Internet, and proposes some but not all solutions._

## Get started

### Precondition

#### 1.
If your school uses web authentication, you need to install Chrome and Chromedriver first. 
Please note that the versions of Chrome and Chromedriver must be the same. 
Otherwise, unknown errors may occur, such as failure to debug Chrome using Chromedriver.

_You can choose your own version to install, but it is still recommended that you install our recommended version._
